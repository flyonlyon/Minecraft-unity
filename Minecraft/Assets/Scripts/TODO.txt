[ ] Implement Basic World Generation
    - Introduce simple world generation with 2d perlin noise
[ ] Implement Greedy Meshing
    - Combine meshes of similar blocktypes to reduce the amount of data being passed to the GPU
[ ] Implement Ambient Occlusion
    - Add shade to the corners/edges of blocks based on positioning
[ ] Improve Multithreading
    - Implement thread pooling, keeping threads busy no matter the distribution of jobs
    - Make the number of threads variable
[ ] Implement A Player Controller
    - Give the player a way to move/look around
    - Player should collide with blocks
[ ] Implement Placing/Breaking Blocks
    - Player should break blocks when left clicking, break blocks when right clicking
[ ] Add Transparent Blocks
    - New transparent material needs to be made and added to a new transparent mesh
[ ] Add Water
    - Create unique shapes 
[ ] Implement Advanced World Generation
    - Generate terrain height using 2d fractal perlin noise and a na√Øve derivative
[ ] Implement Caves and Ores
    - Generate caves using 3d perlin noise and lodes
[ ] Introduce Biomes
    - Create multiple biome profiles, each with their own distinct look
    - Blend terrain heights together based on biome contribution

[1] Chunk Loading/Rendering
    - When moving fase, some chunks stay rendered -- not sure there's an easy fix tbh
    - When reaching the world border, some chunks duplicate/stay rendered
    - Chunks near the corner of the world do not render
